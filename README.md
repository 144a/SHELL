# SHELL

Well, I thought it would be cool to replicate the images of large electron shells accurately. And since the calculator is the easiest medium to program it on, it happen to be the first I completed it on. It accepts the proton count of any element, and will return the corresponding electron configuration and electron shell visualization. It should work all the way up until element 118.

The text files allow for easy observation of the code with out the ti connect editor.
